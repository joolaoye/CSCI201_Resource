Description:
This program simulates a Driver's License Exam

It reads the answers to the exam from an input file and stores it in array
It prompts user for an answer to an exam question. Answer should be between A - D
If the user enters an invalid option, the program displays a friendly error message and prompt the user again
If the user enters a valid option, user's answer is stored in an array 
The program repeats lines 2 through 3 20 times
When the user has answered all 20 questions, the program compares all their answer with the ones from the file
If the user didn't get a question correctly, the number of question missed is incremented and the question number is stored in an array
At the end of the loop, the program checks if user answered at least 15 questions correctly
If the user answered at least 15 questions correctly, the program displays a message telling them they passed
If the user answered less than 15 questions correctly, the program displays a message telling them they faied
The program then displays the question numbers of questions the user answered incorrectly
